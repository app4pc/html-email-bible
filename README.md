	- Media query and too much HTML tags and CSS are are not supported cross platform. So better to go for tested HTML/CSS tags.
	- Try to use inline CSS.
	- It's better to check how does your email look on several devices and platforms.
	- It should look decent even if no image is there because some provider blocks the image or ask user to download it manually
